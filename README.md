   git push origin main
   ```

**Person B's turn:**

1. **Pull the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Add your information:**
   ```bash
   echo "Collaborator: [Your Name]" >> project-info.txt
   ```

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add project-info.txt
   git commit -m "Add collaborator info"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Person A:**

1. **Pull the updates:**

## ‚öîÔ∏è Exercise 2: Your First Merge Conflict

### Goal: Create and resolve a merge conflict

This exercise will intentionally create a conflict so you can learn how to resolve it.

**Both persons do this simultaneously (don't communicate!):**

1. **Make sure you both have the latest version:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Both edit the same line in `project-info.txt`:**
   
   **Person A** - Change the first line to:
   ```
   # Amazing Collaborative Project - Updated by Person A
   ```
   
   **Person B** - Change the first line to:
   ```
   # Fantastic Collaborative Project - Updated by Person B
   ```

3. **Both add and commit (but don't push yet!):**
   ```bash
   git add project-info.txt
   git commit -m "Update project title"
   ```

4. **Person A pushes first:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Person B tries to push:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   
   ‚ùå **You should get an error!** This is expected.

### Resolving the Conflict

**Person B (who got the error):**

1. **Pull the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   
   You'll see a conflict message. Don't panic! üö®

2. **Open `project-info.txt` in your text editor.**
   
   You'll see something like:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   # Fantastic Collaborative Project - Updated by Person B
   =======
   # Amazing Collaborative Project - Updated by Person A
   >>>>>>> [commit-hash]
   ```

3. **Resolve the conflict by editing the file:**
   
   Remove the conflict markers and decide on the final version:
   ```
   # Epic Collaborative Project - Updated by Both A and B
   ```

4. **Save the file, then add and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add project-info.txt
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in project title"
   ```

5. **Push the resolved conflict:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

**Person A:**

1. **Pull to see the resolution:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

üéâ **Congratulations!** You've resolved your first merge conflict!

## üåü Exercise 3: Multiple File Conflicts

### Goal: Practice with more complex conflicts

**Setup (Both persons):**

1. **Pull latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Person A creates a team members file:**
   ```bash
   echo "# Team Members" > team.txt
   echo "Leader: Person A" >> team.txt
   echo "Skills: Git basics" >> team.txt
   git add team.txt
   git commit -m "Add team file"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Person B pulls and creates a goals file:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   echo "# Project Goals" > goals.txt
   echo "1. Learn Git collaboration" >> goals.txt
   echo "2. Practice conflict resolution" >> goals.txt
   git add goals.txt
   git commit -m "Add project goals"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Person A pulls the goals:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Creating Multiple Conflicts

**Both persons do this simultaneously:**

**Person A:**
1. Edit `team.txt`:
   ```
   # Team Members
   Leader: Person A (Git Expert)
   Developer: Person B
   Skills: Advanced Git workflows
   ```

2. Edit `goals.txt`:
   ```
   # Project Goals
   1. Master Git collaboration
   2. Practice conflict resolution
   3. Learn branching strategies
   ```

3. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update team and goals - Person A version"
   ```

**Person B:**
1. Edit `team.txt`:
   ```
   # Team Members
   Co-Leader: Person A
   Co-Leader: Person B (Conflict Resolver)
   Skills: Git collaboration and teamwork
   ```

2. Edit `goals.txt`:
   ```
   # Project Goals
   1. Learn Git collaboration thoroughly
   2. Practice conflict resolution like pros
   3. Understand merge strategies
   ```

3. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update team and goals - Person B version"
   ```

### Push and Resolve

1. **Person A pushes first:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Person B tries to push and gets conflict:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main  # This will fail
   git pull origin main  # This will show conflicts
   ```

3. **Person B resolves both files:**
   
   For `team.txt`, create a combined version:
   ```
   # Team Members
   Co-Leader: Person A (Git Expert)
   Co-Leader: Person B (Conflict Resolver)
   Skills: Advanced Git workflows and teamwork
   ```
   
   For `goals.txt`, create a combined version:
   ```
   # Project Goals
   1. Master Git collaboration thoroughly
   2. Practice conflict resolution like pros
   3. Learn branching and merge strategies
   ```

4. **Commit the resolution:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve multiple file conflicts"
   git push origin main
   ```

## üéØ Exercise 4: Prevention is Better Than Cure

### Goal: Learn to avoid conflicts

**Best Practice: Communicate and coordinate**

**Person A:**
1. **Announce your plans:**
   - "I'm going to work on the README file"
   
2. **Create a feature:**
   ```bash
   echo "# Installation Guide" > installation.md
   echo "1. Install Git" >> installation.md
   echo "2. Clone repository" >> installation.md
   git add installation.md
   git commit -m "Add installation guide"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Person B:**
1. **Announce your plans:**
   - "I'll work on a different file - troubleshooting guide"
   
2. **Pull first, then create:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   echo "# Troubleshooting" > troubleshooting.md
   echo "## Common Issues" >> troubleshooting.md
   echo "- Merge conflicts: Don't panic!" >> troubleshooting.md
   git add troubleshooting.md
   git commit -m "Add troubleshooting guide"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Person A pulls the updates:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

üéâ **No conflicts!** Communication prevents problems.

## üîß Exercise 5: Using Branches (Advanced)

### Goal: Learn to use branches to avoid conflicts

**Person A creates a branch:**
1. ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-documentation
   echo "# Documentation" > docs.md
   echo "This project teaches Git collaboration" >> docs.md
   git add docs.md
   git commit -m "Add documentation"
   git push origin feature-documentation
   ```

**Person B creates a different branch:**
1. ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-examples
   mkdir examples
   echo "git clone [url]" > examples/basic-commands.txt
   git add examples/
   git commit -m "Add example commands"
   git push origin feature-examples
   ```

**Merging branches (Person A):**
1. ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge feature-documentation
   git push origin main
   ```

**Person B merges their branch:**
1. ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main  # Gets Person A's changes
   git merge feature-examples
   git push origin main
   ```

## üìù Exercise 6: Real-World Scenario

### Goal: Simulate a real development workflow

**The Scenario:** You're both working on a simple website for your workshop.

**Person A - Setup the project:**
1. ```bash
   echo "<!DOCTYPE html>" > index.html
   echo "<html><head><title>Git Workshop</title></head>" >> index.html
   echo "<body><h1>Welcome to Git Workshop</h1></body></html>" >> index.html
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Create basic HTML structure"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Person B - Add styling:**
1. ```bash
   git pull origin main
   echo "body { font-family: Arial; background-color: #f0f0f0; }" > style.css
   echo "h1 { color: #333; text-align: center; }" >> style.css
   git add style.css
   git commit -m "Add CSS styling"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Both persons - Add content simultaneously:**

**Person A** adds to `index.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html><head><title>Git Workshop</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Git Workshop</h1>
  <p>Learn Git collaboration with hands-on exercises!</p>
  <h2>What You'll Learn:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic Git commands</li>
    <li>Collaboration workflows</li>
  </ul>
</body></html>
```

**Person B** also edits `index.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Awesome Git Workshop</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Git Workshop</h1>
  <p>Master Git through practical exercises!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Resolution:**
1. Person A pushes first
2. Person B gets conflict and resolves by combining the best of both:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Awesome Git Workshop</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Git Workshop</h1>
  <p>Learn Git collaboration with hands-on exercises!</p>
  <h2>What You'll Learn:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic Git commands</li>
    <li>Collaboration workflows</li>
    <li>Conflict resolution</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

## üìû Need Help?

If you get stuck during the workshop:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - Git usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Use `git status`** - It often suggests what to do next
3. **Don't panic about conflicts** - They're normal and fixable
4. **Ask your partner or workshop facilitator** - Collaboration includes asking for help!

Remember: Every Git expert has made mistakes and faced confusing conflicts. The key is to practice and not be afraid to experiment!
